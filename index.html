    <h3> Behind the name </h3>
    <p> Why is it called Studio Ghibli? The name “Ghibli” refers to the Italian word for the “Hot Sahara Wind.” The name is fitting because the studio wanted to “blow new wind through the anime industry.” 
    The name also refers to Miyazaki’s (Co-Founder) love for Italy and planes. He was inspired by the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli, a surveillance aircraft that was designed in Italy during the Second World War.

    <h3> The Beginnings of Studio Ghibli></h3>
    <p> Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior to the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together before. Takahata and Miyazaki first met in the 1960s when they both worked for Japanese animation studio Tôei Dôga. They worked together for more than a decade, but it wasn't until the mid 1980s that they decided to start their own venture. In 1985—with funding from Tokyo-based publishing company Tokuma Shoten—Takahata, Miyazaki, and Suzuki founded Studio Ghibli, a small production studio in the suburbs of Tokyo.
    Unlike other animation studios at the time, Studio Ghibli didn’t care for international commercial success at first. The makers purely wanted to use their art to explore the depths of the human experience, and tell heart-felt, poetic stories. Void of traditional villains, even the Ghibli antagonists are somewhat likable, each with their own backstory to explain their behavior.

    <h3> Japanese Entertainment </h3>
    <p> The logo for Studio Ghibli from 1985–1991 created by Hayao Miyazaki. During the this time period no one knew how successful Studio Ghibli would be in the future, however this was before the movie that made their brand was created.
    In 1988, My Neighbors Totoro and Firedrop Tomb were made. They soon become highly acclaimed as literary movies, causing them to gain popularity. Along with the movies, the company started becoming a household name through merchandising, specifically with Totoro. From bags to stuffed toys, the character was loved by everyone.</p>
    
	<h3> International Aclaim </h3>
    <p> In the next year  - 1989 -  the movie Kiki’s Delivery Service came out. 2.64 million people came to the theater and it became the No.1 hit. This started the companies upward climb of gaining success. In following years every movie that had come out was better than the last. Studio Ghibli’s success, gaining popularity overseas, and winning academy awards,  the company decided to relocate the main building as well as rebrand. In 1991 Hayao Miyazaki remade the logo. It was a blue background with the character Totoro from the film My Neighbor Totoro. Another smaller Totoro-like creature is also seen on his head. The Japanese characters “スタジオジブリ作品” are seen on the bottom right, and underneath that is “STUDIO GHIBLI” in all capitals, with a line above it. This logo was made in hopes to both appeal to the western and Japanese audience, which it was due to the fact that it was multilingual.</p>

	<h3> The Magic of Studio Ghibli Films </h3>
	<p> Studio Ghibli films tell many different types of stories in his films, and they do not make sequels. But certain themes appear again and again. Environmentalism, and humankind’s relationship with nature, are themes that are ever-present in his work. For example, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (Studio Ghibli’s first movie) examines humankind’s propensity to destroy the environment, and looks at how nature cleanses itself from our destructive tendencies. Princess Mononoke explores the conflict between human progress and nature, revolving around an ironworking town in the centre of the forest. </p>
	<p> Many of Studio Ghibli’s movies have a female heroine, and their works have feminist angles. Mr. Miyazaki says he likes to create female characters because he does not want his films to ﻿reflect only his own experiences. From  Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa’s self-sacrifice gives her a Joan of Arc-like quality, although Miyazaki has always regretted the religious overtones that crept into the film. Spirited Away and the cheerful Kiki’s Delivery Service are coming-of-age stories about young girls. The strange Ponyo features a girl fish who simply will not stop trying to become a human girl so that she can be with the boy she likes. </p>
	<p>Militarism comes up often, most noticeably in Grave of the Fireflies, which is set during World War 2, and Nausicaa, which features the military invasion of a peaceful country. Miyazaki is ashamed of the Japanese imperialism of the 20th century, and is highly critical of the mindset behind it. He has said that such imperialism is not representative of all of Japan’s history, and says he tries to look beyond it. </p>
	<p>There are many flying scenes animated in their various films, and it is a big theme of Studio Ghibli films. This is because Mr. Miyazaki’s father designed planes, and Ghibli shares its name with an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Miyazaki likes the connection between creative design and engineering that goes into aeroplane design, and thinks it is similar to the process of making animated films. </p>
	<p>Characters in these films are not protected from the horrors of life – they experience loss and sadness as well as joy, despair as well as hope, in a way that is relatable for both children and adults. Similarly, these movies do not shy away from addressing adult themes such as militarism and environmentalism. Mr. Miyazaki (co-founder) believes that children should be exposed to such ideas and will understand them if they are presented correctly.These movies draw heavily on Japanese landscapes and culture, although the humanism of their films means they can be appreciated by international viewers. </p>

	<h3> The Animation Styles of Studio Ghibli </h3>
	<p> Much of Studio Ghibli’s approach to animation is based on Japanese anime, but is uniquely their own. Each of their films look different, and each uses a unique colour scheme and a library of shapes. Like most animators, Miyazaki is interested in conveying movement, and his skill at depicting human movement has played a big part in his success.Studio Ghibli animation does not favour 3D animation styles like many other animators. Japanese anime is characterised by a flat, 2D, hand-drawn look, and this studio has always been a staunch proponent of traditional – and laborious – hand-drawn techniques. </p>
	<p> However, since their film Princess Mononoke (1997), Studio Ghibli has used computer animation to enhance some scenes. The studio developed a special programme with an outside company that gives computer animation a hand-drawn look. It is only used to create scenes that could not be drawn by hand, such as the transformation of the great Boar God in Princess Mononoke into a demon. </p>
